## Telegram bot for typing stickers from keyboard
This bot helps you to access stickers from keyboard! You can save stickers with shortcuts and then find them in any chat by calling the bot in inline mode. <br> <br>
I was inspired by Slack emojis. <br> <br>

I also log how people use commands to get some insights on possible problems (I'm a data analyst mainly, not a developer xD).

P.S. .py and .ipynb files are identical, I am just more comfortable with writing code in Jupyter Notebook (Sorry...) and running .py version of notebook in screen.
